FILE FORMAT / EXTENSION

Consider XHTML, although the format would not be entirely compliant with XHTML, to get decent syntax highlighting.

STYLES

Styles should support different units, such as pt (1/72 in), mm, cm, etc. The default should be mm.
When parsing, all of these should be transformed to a base unit (mm?)
