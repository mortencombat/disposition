> [!IMPORTANT]
> This framework is in the early stages of planning/development. It is not yet available for use.

**disposition** is a Python-based framework for generating reports and plots with flexible and precise layouts.

It uses [stretchable](https://github.com/mortencombat/stretchable) (CSS Grid/Flexbox) for layouting and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for rendering.
